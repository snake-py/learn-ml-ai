- We can measure how well a line fits by measuring loss.
- The goal of linear regression is to minimize loss.
- To find the line of best fit, we try to find the b value (intercept) and the m value (slope) that minimize loss.
- Convergence refers to when the parameters stop changing with each iteration. So no more iterations are required to find the correct b and m value
- Learning rate refers to how much the parameters are changed on each iteration. This can vastly change the curve.
- We can use Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression() model to perform linear regression on a set of points
