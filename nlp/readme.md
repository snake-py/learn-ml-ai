# NLP

Three steps to NLP:

- preprocessing
- modeling (preprocessing + training)
- postprocessing    

# Preprocessing or called normalization 

- remove punctuation and upper/lower case
- tokenization (assign a unique id to each word)
- stemming (bluntly remove suffixes, like -ing, -ly, -ed, -s and)
- lemmatization (assign a unique lemma to each word, like substitute each word by its root, e.g. 'is' by 'be' or went by 'go') 
- stopword removal (remove stopwords, like and, the, a, is, etc.)
